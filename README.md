### Hi there my name is Ishmel DramaniðŸ‘‹

## An introduction to a passionate software engineering student 
* I am a passionate and resilient software engineering student with a strong urge to learn more information. My life started of in Bermondsey in a very cultural diverse neighbourhood deep in the heart of London. This is where i spent a large portion of my childhood. A lot of my early life consisted of playing outside, studying in school and bonding with family members. Later on i moved to Woolwich in south east London followed by a **4  year** trip to Ghana where i learnt my roots and differences between cultures. My love for computers and technology came soon after that as i started to wonder how the games i loved so much were made with such precision and fluidity.*
