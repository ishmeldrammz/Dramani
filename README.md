### Hi there my name is Ishmel DramaniðŸ‘‹

## An introduction to a passionate software engineering student 
*I am a passionate and resilient software engineering student with a strong urge to learn more information. My life started of in Bermondsey in a very cultural diverse neighbourhood deep in the heart of London. This is where i spent a large portion of my childhood. A lot of my early life consisted of playing outside, studying in school and bonding with family members. Later on i moved to Woolwich in south east London followed by a **4  year** trip to Ghana where i learnt my roots and differences between cultures. My love for computers and technology came soon after that as i started to wonder how the games i loved so much were made with such precision and fluidity.*

## My education
### Secondary school
*I spent my secondary school years studying at Harris Academy Greenwich, this was a great experience for me and its firm attidute towards education led to me attaining vBcs Level 2 in ECDL and 9 A-C's in my GCSEs.*
These were:
* An A in English Literature
* A B in Mathematics
* A B in Religious Studies
* A B in Biology
* A B in English Language
* A B in Chemistry
* A B in History
* A C in Physics
* A C in Resistant Materials

### College life
*I went to Christ The King college in Lewisham to for a BTEC in engineering but shortly after realised that mechinal engineering was not the path I wanted to go down, by this time it was too late so i stayed on the course and continued studying whilst working at Whsmith on the weekends. I am grateful for the college as i met a lot of good people and formed strong bonds during my time there.*

## Work life
*After college i worked at a Amazon as a warehouse operative in Dartford. Whilst I was here i expanded my team working and problem solving skills as we were tasked with making sure that the warehouse was in order and customers received their products on time. After this I went to work in an Argos distribution centre in Belvedere. This was a very small warehouse and everyone there felt like family. I believe it is crucial to work in a warm and friendly environment, this ensures everyone is comfortable and works to the highest of their ability. The managers saw my egearness to learn and ability to complete tasks to perfection, this led to me receiving leadership roles and tasks.*

## Where i am now
*I left my role at Argos and I am currently pursuing my passion for techlonogy. This led to me doing a software engineering course with Cogrammar which is taking me in the right direction and leading me on the path to success. I am completing all of my tasks in a good time and fashion whilst taking extra time to learn more whilst I am not in lectures. I beleive that I will be a huge asset to any company that shows interest in me because I will not rest until I find solutions to problems and will do things to the highest of my capabilities whilst trying to go above the standard*
